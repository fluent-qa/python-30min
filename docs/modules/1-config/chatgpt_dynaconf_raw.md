Prompt: how to use dynaconf to reload configuration

Warp AI: To use Dynaconf to reload configuration, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Dynaconf using pip:
```shell
pip install dynaconf
```

2. Create a configuration file (e.g., `settings.toml`, `settings.yaml`, or `settings.json`) with your desired configuration values.

3. Import the `dynaconf` module in your Python script:
```python
from dynaconf import settings
```

4. Access the configuration values using the `settings` object. For example:
```python
db_host = settings.get('DB_HOST')
db_port = settings.get('DB_PORT')
```

5. If you want to reload the configuration at runtime, you can use the `reload` method provided by Dynaconf. For example:
```python
settings.reload()
```

By calling `settings.reload()`, Dynaconf will reload the configuration file and update the values in the `settings` object. You can then access the updated values as needed.

Note: Dynaconf supports various configuration file formats such as TOML, YAML, JSON, INI, and more. Make sure to choose the appropriate format for your configuration file and update the file path accordingly when initializing Dynaconf.

Prompt: how to change environement layer in dynaconf

Warp AI: In Dynaconf, you can change the environment layer by setting the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable. The environment layer determines which set of configuration values to use based on the current environment.

Here's how you can change the environment layer in Dynaconf:

1. Set the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable to the desired environment layer. For example, if you want to switch to the "production" environment layer, you can run the following command in your shell:
```shell
export ENV_FOR_DYNACONF=production
```

2. In your Python script, import the `dynaconf` module and access the configuration values using the `settings` object. For example:
```python
from dynaconf import settings

db_host = settings.get('DB_HOST')
db_port = settings.get('DB_PORT')
```

By setting the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable, Dynaconf will load the configuration values specific to the specified environment layer. You can then access these values using the `settings` object.

Note: Make sure to set the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable before running your Python script or starting your application.

Prompt: how to set ENV_FOR_DYNACONF in python and after reset the ENV_FOR_DYNACONF, reload all settings

Warp AI: To set `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` in Python and reload all settings after resetting it, you can use the following code:

```python
import os
from dynaconf import settings

# Set ENV_FOR_DYNACONF to the desired environment layer
os.environ['ENV_FOR_DYNACONF'] = 'production'

# Reload all settings
settings.reload()

# Access the configuration values
db_host = settings.get('DB_HOST')
db_port = settings.get('DB_PORT')

# Reset ENV_FOR_DYNACONF
del os.environ['ENV_FOR_DYNACONF']

# Reload all settings again
settings.reload()

# Access the updated configuration values
db_host_updated = settings.get('DB_HOST')
db_port_updated = settings.get('DB_PORT')
```

In this code, we first set the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable to the desired environment layer ('production' in this example). Then, we call `settings.reload()` to load the configuration values specific to the 'production' environment.

After that, we access the configuration values (`db_host` and `db_port`) based on the initial environment layer.

Next, we reset the `ENV_FOR_DYNACONF` environment variable by deleting it from the `os.environ` dictionary. Then, we call `settings.reload()` again to reload all settings without the environment layer.

Finally, we access the updated configuration values (`db_host_updated` and `db_port_updated`) after resetting the environment layer.

Note: Make sure to import the `os` module before using it to set or delete environment variables.

Prompt: how to add reload hook in dynaconf

Warp AI: To add a reload hook in Dynaconf, you can use the `@dynaconf.hookimpl` decorator provided by Dynaconf. This allows you to define a function that will be called whenever the configuration is reloaded.

Here's an example of how to add a reload hook in Dynaconf:

```python
from dynaconf import settings
from dynaconf.hooks import dynaconf_hookimpl

@dynaconf_hookimpl
def dynaconf_reload_hook(data, **kwargs):
    # Custom logic to be executed when the configuration is reloaded
    print("Configuration reloaded!")
    # Additional code here...

# Access the configuration values
db_host = settings.get('DB_HOST')
db_port = settings.get('DB_PORT')

# Reload the configuration
settings.reload()

# The reload hook function will be called automatically
```

In this example, we define a function called `dynaconf_reload_hook` and decorate it with `@dynaconf_hookimpl`. This decorator registers the function as a reload hook in Dynaconf.

Inside the `dynaconf_reload_hook` function, you can define any custom logic that you want to execute when the configuration is reloaded. In this case, we simply print a message, but you can add any additional code or perform any necessary actions.

After defining the reload hook function, you can access the configuration values using `settings.get()` as usual. When you call `settings.reload()`, Dynaconf will automatically invoke the reload hook function.

Note: Make sure to import the necessary modules (`settings` and `dynaconf_hookimpl`) from the `dynaconf` package.

Prompt: how to change a dynaconf value to trigger reload

Warp AI: To change a Dynaconf value and trigger a reload, you can use the `set()` method provided by Dynaconf. This method allows you to update a configuration value and automatically triggers a reload of the configuration.

Here's an example of how to change a Dynaconf value to trigger a reload:

```python
from dynaconf import settings

# Access the configuration value before changing it
db_host = settings.get('DB_HOST')
print(f"DB_HOST before change: {db_host}")

# Change the configuration value
settings.set('DB_HOST', 'new_host_value')

# Access the updated configuration value
db_host_updated = settings.get('DB_HOST')
print(f"DB_HOST after change: {db_host_updated}")
```

In this example, we first access the current value of the `DB_HOST` configuration using `settings.get()`. Then, we print the value before changing it.

Next, we use `settings.set()` to update the `DB_HOST` configuration value to a new value ('new_host_value' in this example).

After changing the value, we can use `settings.get()` again to access the updated value. Finally, we print the updated value.

When you call `settings.set()` to change a configuration value, Dynaconf automatically triggers a reload of the configuration. This means that any reload hooks or other actions associated with the reload will be executed.

Note: Make sure to import the `settings` module from the `dynaconf` package before using it to access or change configuration values.
