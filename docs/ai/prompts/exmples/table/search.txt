*** data retrieval task ***
Please look up the descriptions, as well as most relevant github repo, pip packagefor each row and then fill in the data return the filled table. Descriptions are often easily found on the page of the link I am already including in the table above

For the descriptions, try searching "a16z llm app stack" and looking for descriptions in that article, in addition to searching for descriptions of the company/product names

For the github link:
- make sure it is an actual github repo, with org/repo, not the org or user page
- for databricks, it would be https://github.com/apache/spark, which is their most popular open source project they support
- for airflow, it would be https://github.com/apache/airflow
- if you can't find anything that seems like the main project of that company, leave it blank

For pip packages, make sure you insert the installable project name:
- for databricks, it is pyspark
- this is often found by search 'pypi [company name]' or '[company name] pip install'
- if you can't find anything that seems like the main package of that company, leave it blank
- Make to search for the pip package we requested in *** Task: Table to fill in ***
